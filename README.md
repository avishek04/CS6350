# HW2 Instructions:

Every code file has their own run.sh file added in each directory. Here is what my run.sh file looks like:


------------


#! /bin/bash

echo "running python code..."

python3 batchGD.py

------------


In the above texts please change "python3" with the version of python used in the system the code will be run.


Please find the directory for each coding question below:


2 a - Ensemble Learning/ AdaBoost

2 b - Ensemble Learning/ Bagging

2 c - Ensemble Learning/ BiasVarianceDecomp

2 d - Ensemble Learning/ RandomForest

2 e - Ensemble Learning/ BiasVarianceDecompRandomForest

3 - Bonus

4 a - Linear Regression/ BatchGradientDescent

4 b - Linear Regression/ StochasticGradientDescent

Note: I have implemented the python code to directly output the charts where it was asked to report a figure.
