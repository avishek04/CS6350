# HW4 Instructions

Every code file has their own run.sh file added in each directory. Here is what my run.sh file looks like:


------------


# ! /bin/bash

echo "running python code..."

python3 primalSVM.py

------------


In the above texts please change "python3" with the version of python used in the system the code will be run.


Please find the directory for each coding question below:


2 a - 2_SVMPrimal/ a_GammaWithA

2 b - 2_SVMPrimal/ b_GammaWithoutA

3 a - 3_SVMDual/ a_SVMDual

3 b - 3_SVMDual/ b_SVMNonLinear

3 c - 3_SVMDual/ c_SVMNonLinear

3 d - 3_SVMDual/ d_KernelPerceptron

Note: I have implemented the python code to directly output the charts where it was asked to report a figure.
